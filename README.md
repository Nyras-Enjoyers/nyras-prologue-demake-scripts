# Scripts from Nyras Prologue Demake 
The scripts of Nyras Prologue Demake project – the port of Nyras Prologue on Gothic 1 engine

Based on [Gothic 1 Remake - Demo (Nyras Prologue)](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3448280/Gothic_1_Remake__Demo_Nyras_Prologue)

Assets from Nyras Prologue Demake can be found on [GitHub]([https://github.com/Nyras-Enjoyers/scripts-nyras-prologue-demake](https://github.com/Nyras-Enjoyers/nyras-prologue-demake-assets))

## SUMMARY

The scripts are written in Polish. They are connected with [Weblate project](https://weblate.cokoliv.eu/projects/nyras-prolog-demake/), which uses `.csv` files with translations stored on [translation](https://github.com/Nyras-Enjoyers/scripts-nyras-prologue-demake/tree/translation/.translations) branch. Then thanks to Auronen's tool the scripts are substituted with the translations to get the scripts in 10 languages (without Japanese, because it requires manual translation).

The translations available in _Nyras Prolog Demake_ project come from [Gothic 1 Remake demo](https://weblate.cokoliv.eu/projects/gothic-1-remake-demo/) and [Gothic 1](https://weblate.cokoliv.eu/projects/gothic-1/) projects on Weblate.
